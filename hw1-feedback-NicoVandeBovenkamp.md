**Overall:** Good work, and definitely on track! You outlined a very strong initial approach, via statistical analysis and testing, to analyze the data.

**Some notes**

* ***Part 2 - Q.1:*** Table looks good! However, the rank or prestige of the school is actually a discrete, ordinal or categorical measure. The data can only take values in the set: {1, 2, 3, 4}. Also, make sure that when you say, "we would like to explore the relationship between X and Y" that X and Y are defined {'gre','gpa','Prestige'} and {'admit'}.
